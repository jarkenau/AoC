# Advent of Code

Repository for my solutions of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a
> variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming
> language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training,
> university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge
> each other.

I'll try my best to solve the problems as nicely as possible :shushing_face:
